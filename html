            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello :) I'm Mariangel, a first-generation, second-year PhD Student in the EEB program within the Integrative Biology Department at the University of Texas at Austin. My main research interests are Microbial Ecology and Host-Microbe Coevolution.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I was born and raised in Venezuela.</li>
                <li>At 15, my family decided to leave Venezuela.</li>
                <li>Our journey led us to a small town in North Carolina, where I faced the daunting task of adapting to a new language and culture.</li>
                <li>As a teenager, this transition was incredibly challenging.</li>
                <li>Despite the difficulties, in 2023, I proudly graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Biology, equipped with a wealth of knowledge and determination to positively impact this field.</li>
                <li>I aim to inspire more students from diverse backgrounds to pursue advanced careers in science and show them that achieving their dreams is possible.</li>
            </ul>
